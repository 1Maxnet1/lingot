Description
===========

Lingot is a musical instrument tuner. It's accurate, easy to use, and highly
configurable. Originally conceived to tune electric guitars, it can now be used
to tune other instruments.

It looks like an analog tuner, with a gauge indicating the relative shift to a
certain note found automatically as the closest note to the estimated frequency.


Requirements
============

* Sound card.
* Linux kernel with audio support (OSS, ALSA, JACK or PulseAudio).
* GTK+ library, version 3.10.
    

Installation
============

If you are building a release, just type:

 > ./configure
 > make install

If you are building a development version obtained from our VCS you will need to
create the configure script first by calling:

 > ./bootstrap


Lingot supports the following audio systems/servers:

  OSS
  ALSA
  JACK
  PulseAudio
  
You can enable/disable each of them with the following options passed to the
configure script, all of them enabled by default:

  --enable-oss=<yes|no>
  --enable-alsa=<yes|no>
  --enable-jack=<yes|no>
  --enable-pulseaudio=<yes|no>

Also, the depedency to libfftw can be enabled/disabled with

  --enable-libfftw=<yes|no>

Please, see the INSTALL file.
    
    
Synopsis
========

    lingot [-c config]

The -c option causes the search of a file named {config}.conf in the
~/.config/lingot/ folder. For example:

    lingot -c bass

will take the configuration file ~/.config/lingot/bass.conf. This is useful for
maintaining different configurations for different instruments. It's also
possible to load and save configuration files from the GUI. The default
configuration file is ~/.config/lingot/lingot.conf.
