# LINGOT - A musical instrument tuner.

<img align="right" src="http://lingot.nongnu.org/images/lingot-black-main.png">

LINGOT is a musical instrument tuner. Itâ€™s accurate, easy to use, and highly configurable. Originally conceived to tune electric
guitars, it can be used to tune other instruments.

It looks like an analogue tuner, with a gauge indicating the relative shift to a certain note,
determined automatically as the closest note to the estimated frequency.


## Main features

* It is free software, distributed under the [GPL license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).
* Quick and accurate, perfect for real-time microtonal tuning.
* Easy to use. Just plug in your instrument and run it.
* _LINGOT_ is a universal tuner. It can tune many musical instruments, you only need to provide the scale _temperaments_. For that purpose, it supports the [.scl format](http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/scl_format.html) from the [Scala project](http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/).
* Configurable via GUI. It is possible to change any parameter while the program is running, without editing any file.

## Requirements

* A modest computer running _GNU/Linux_.
* A sound card with line-in or microphone input.
* [Jack](http://www.jackaudio.org/), [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page), [OSS](http://www.opensound.com/oss.html) or [PulseAudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) support.
* [GTK+](https://www.gtk.org/) library, version _3.10_ or above.

## Installation

If you are building a release, just type:

```console
./configure
make install
```

If you are building a development version obtained from our VCS you will first need to
create the _configure_ script, by calling:

```console
./bootstrap
```

The supported audio systems (alsa, oss, jack, pulseaudio) and the Fast
Fourier Transform [libfftw](http://fftw.org) library can be
enabled/disabled independently via options passed to the _configure_
script.
The following command displays all options and defaut value.
```console
./configure --help

```

Below a summary of the packages needed to build a development version on _Debian-based_ systems:

```console
sudo apt-get install \
    intltool \
    libasound2-dev \
    libcunit1-dev \
    libfftw3-dev \
    libgtk-3-dev \
    libjack-jackd2-dev \
    libpulse-dev \
    libtool \
    libxml2-utils \
    pkg-config
```
