LINGOT - A musical instrument tuner.

Configuration file
==================

When lingot is launched for the first time, the default configuration file
~/.config/lingot/lingot.conf will be created.

The default values are optimized for tuning electric guitars, other musical
instruments might require these values to be slightly changed (a good practice
would be to have a configuration file for each instrument). The options can be
changed via GUI.

There is a wide range of options, with the purpose of keeping the maximum
configurability. Some background in signal processing is needed for a good
understanding of all of their effects.

We detail the main options that constitute this file, and we recommend to make
changes depending on the desired tuning precision and demanded CPU time. If you
don't understand the effects of some options, then just try different values or,
even better, don't change them.


 AUDIO_SYSTEM

    Audio system switch. Possible values:

    OSS
    ALSA        [default value]
    JACK
    PulseAudio


 AUDIO_DEV.OSS

    Selected sound device for the OSS audio system. The default value is
    '/dev/dsp'.


 AUDIO_DEV.ALSA

    Selected sound device for ALSA, the default value is 'default'.


 AUDIO_DEV.JACK

    Selected sound port for JACK, the default value is 'default'.


 AUDIO_DEV.PulseAudio

    Selected sound device for PulseAudio, the default value is 'default'.


 ROOT_FREQUENCY_ERROR ("A" reference note shift)

    This option is used when we want to tune with a certain amount of shift
    in frequency.

    This can be useful when tuning an instrument against a recording with a
    shifted tuning. For example, if we hear an "A" note in a recording that
    it's a quarter of a tone over the real frequency (440 Hz), we can put 50
    cents of shift here.

    It must be a real number, expressed in cents. The default value is 0.


 FFT_SIZE (Size of the FTT)

    A high value gets more accuracy, especially more precision locking the
    desired frequency, but it demands more CPU time.

    We must consider the time interval involved on the calculus before
    unnecessarily raising this value: having a buffer of 4096 samples for the
    FFT, and a sampling rate of 8 KHz, each transform needs the last 512 ms
    temporary values, so there is no point in putting a shorter temporal window.

    It must be an integer power of 2. The default value is 512 samples.


 TEMPORAL_WINDOW

    The length in time of the signal used to compute the final frequency. With
    higher values, we'll obtain a more accurate result, but also a slower
    response polluted by earlier notes.

    As a practical rule, we say that if we have a temporal window of 1 second,
    we must wait 1 second between two consecutive notes to obtain a correct
    tuning. Therefore, this parameter affects directly to the responsiveness
    of the tuner.

    The temporal window size in samples (obtained as the multiplication of its
    duration in seconds and the effective sampling rate) must be greater than
    the FFT buffer size.

    It must be a real number in seconds. The default value is 0.32 seconds.


 MIN_SNR

    To avoid tuning noise, this is the lower signal-to-noise ratio we require
    to start the tuning process.

    It's a real number whose units are dB. The default value is 20 dB.


 CALCULATION_RATE

    With higher calculations per second, the tuner gives us a better dynamic
    sensation, but it'll need more CPU time.

    It's a real number, in hertz, and the default value is 20 Hz.


 VISUALIZATION_RATE

    It has impact in the dynamism sensation achieved, but less in the
    computation time.

    There is no point having a calculation rate greater than the visualization
    rate.

    It's a real number, in hertz. The default value is 30 Hz.


 MINIMUM_FREQUENCY and MAXIMUM_FREQUENCY

    The minimum and maximum notes the instrument can tipically generate. These
    are not hard boundaries, but a guideline to help Lingot set its internal
    parameters.

    They are eal numbers, in hertz. The default values are 82.41 Hz (E2) and
    329.63 Hz (E4)


 SCALE

        Definition of the scale used for the tuning. By default a 12 semitones
        equal-tempered scale is used. It contains several parameters:

        NAME: Scale name, only for your information.
        BASE_FREQUENCY: The absolute frequency - in hertz - of the first note.
        NOTE_COUNT: number of notes in the scale.
        NOTES: list of notes, being them pairs of name and frequency shift. The
                frequency shift can be expressed as a real number in cents or a
                division of integer values, encoding a frequency ratio, like '3/2'
                or '5/4'. Be careful with leaving wide gaps in frequency between each
                pair of adjacent notes, as the gauge range will adapt to the maximum
                of those distances. Try to use scales with at least 12 tones.
